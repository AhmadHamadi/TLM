# Lead Calculator — Benchmark Data & Sources

This documents every number behind the `/calculator` trade dropdown, so any figure is
defensible on a sales call. Data compiled from a two-pass, multi-agent research sweep
(2024–2026 North American paid-search benchmarks).

**Last updated:** 16 Jul 2026

## Methodology

- **"CPL" here = Google Ads SEARCH cost per lead** (an inbound call or form-fill from a
  search campaign). This is deliberately **not** LSA (Local Services Ads) or shared-marketplace
  (Angi/HomeAdvisor/Thumbtack) pricing — those run 40–60% cheaper per lead but are lower-intent
  and/or sold to multiple contractors, so blending them in would understate real cost.
- **Job value = the ticket for a paid-search-acquired customer**, which skews toward
  installs/replacements/emergencies and is therefore **higher than the blended consumer average**
  reported by cost guides (which are dominated by small repairs).
- **Anchor datasets** (the two most methodology-backed, used to cross-check every trade):
  1. **LocaliQ 2025 Home Services Search Benchmarks** — 3,211 US campaigns, per-category medians.
  2. **SearchLight Digital 2026** — account aggregates from millions in real ad spend, CRM-attributed.
- **Important:** LocaliQ and WordStream are the **same company** (WordStream is a LocaliQ property),
  so they count as **one** independent dataset, not two. Independent cross-checks come from
  trade-specific agencies (SearchLight, Hook Agency, Richey, EverGrow, MDMPPC, etc.).
- All figures **USD**. For **CAD**, multiply by ~1.37 (2025–26).
- The calculator uses **cplLo → cplHi** to produce the leads range (`leads = spend ÷ CPL`), and
  `job value` to compute break-even (`jobs = ceil(spend ÷ job value)`).

> Job value note: the calculator ships one "typical" ticket per trade but it's **editable** —
> tune it to the client on the call. Several trades are genuinely **bimodal** (repair vs. install):
> masonry ($500–$1,500 repair vs. $8k–$50k install), excavation ($2,500 grading vs. $20k–$60k
> site work), garage doors ($265 repair vs. $1,200+ install), landscaping ($1,400 maintenance vs.
> $6k–$25k design-build). Pest/cleaning/handyman are recurring — CLV is the stronger pitch.

## Confidence notes (where to be careful)

- **Highest confidence (direct, trade-specific, large-sample):** HVAC, Electrical, Roofing,
  Windows & Doors, Painting, Garage Doors, Landscaping, Cleaning, Handyman — these have a
  trade-specific measured search CPL.
- **Triangulated (no dedicated large-sample dataset — treat CPL as directional):** Solar, Siding,
  Masonry, Concrete, Paving, Fencing, Flooring, Drywall/Insulation, Excavation, Kitchen & Bath.
  Their CPLs are anchored to the broad "Construction & Contractors" ($165.67) / "Home Improvement"
  ($90.92) categories plus trade agencies.
- **Corrected in the deep pass:** Pools — the generic "$45 CPL" figure reflects pool *maintenance*;
  inground **builders** run $75–$300. Fixed.
- Self-managed / brand-new accounts commonly run **40–60% higher CPL for the first ~90 days**.
- 2024→2026 trend is **upward** (CPCs flat/down but conversion rates falling).
